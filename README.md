    How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. 
    
    The best way to create programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to create classes with small functions within it. Other important things that will help is to maintain consitant programming style, using meaningful inline comments, and use names that are discriptive.  
        
    What were the advantages of working in this way? 
    
    Creating code that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using classes and functions is adventitious in a few ways. One of the best ways is it make the code reuseable in future projects. It allows programmers to make change in a class and not have to go through what could be thousands of line of code and make change to every instance of it. Lastly, it allow future programmr to understand how the program is working.  
    
    How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
    
    
    
    How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. 
    
    How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? 
    
    What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
    
    What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? 
    
    How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
