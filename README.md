# CS-340-ClientServer-Development

1.	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two.

The best way to create programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to create classes with small functions within it. Other important things that will help is to maintain consistent programming style, using meaningful inline comments, and use names that are descriptive.

2.	What were the advantages of working in this way?

Creating code that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using classes and functions is adventitious in a few ways. One of the best ways is it make the code reusable in future projects. It allows programmers to make change in a class and not have to go through what could be thousands of lines of code and make change to every instance of it. Lastly, it allows future programmer to understand how the program is working.

3.	How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The CRUD module is completely reusable. All we would have to change is the authentication to fit the new project. We could even at to the module more advanced functions that interacts with the database.

4.	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested.

There is an old saying that I keep coming to when approaching a large project or task. â€œHow do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. In the dashboard of Grazioso Salvare we use full stacked development. we started with the base level, which was the database setup with test data. The next level was the middle layer or the layer that acted like the glue between the base level and the client level. By working from the bottom up, it broke everything down into manageable pieces that connected together to create a working project.    

5.	How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses?

My approach did not really change much. I look at what needs to be done then I schedule out the time I will need to complete a task. By doing this I was overwhelmed with such a large task. 

6.	What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

One thing I learned in this class is that what I have learned just touches on what can be done. If I decide to work in data management, I will have to expand on what I learn already. There are some tips that I will use in the future. The internet is your friend if you do not understand something. When that fails you do not be afraid to ask for help. In this particular case I needed help and I asked for it. In doing so I learned things that I can use later on.

7.	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

The computer scientist is a person that either maintains current technology, expand current technology, or create new technology to solve a problem.  This is important because technology has become integral in our current way of life and the path to our future.

8.	How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

The amount of data for a company is very significant and for one person to go through it all is impossible. The work done for Grazioso Salvare allows him to parse through the data rather quickly. With a click of a button, he can find what he needs in seconds and not need to manually parse thorough the data which would take much longer. Essentially, this type of program would save the user many hours of work and allow him to focus on more important things.
